# TLC_Scripto
TLC_Scripto is a powerful utility library designed to bring a robust Object-Oriented Programming model to the native LabVIEW VI Scripting API. By encapsulating low-level VI Scripting references and functions into distinct, intuitive classes, this library makes programmatic VI manipulation cleaner, safer, and significantly more scalable.
